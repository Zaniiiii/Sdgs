As its name suggests, ECOA hybridizes two new metaheuristics, the coati optimization algorithm (COA) and the osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). ECOA is constructed by five searches performed sequentially by the swarm members. The first three are directed searches, while the last two are neighborhood searches. All three directed searches are adopted from COA and OOA. Meanwhile, the four-bordered neighborhood search is developed based on a new approach. During the assessment, ECOA was challenged to overcome the set of 23 functions and contended with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), golden search optimization (GSO), average and subtraction-based optimization (ASBO), COA, and OOA. The result shows that ECOA outperforms TIA, GSO, ASBO, COA, and OOA in 16, 23, 18, 21, and 21 functions. Meanwhile, the individual search test result shows that the directed searches perform better than the neighborhood searches. Moreover, the directed search toward the best member becomes the most dominant search. \u00a9 (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

As its name suggests, ECOA hybridizes two new metaheuristics, the coati optimization algorithm (COA) and the osprey optimization algorithm (OOA). ECOA is constructed by five searches performed sequentially by the swarm members. The first three are directed searches, while the last two are neighborhood searches. All three directed searches are adopted from COA and OOA. Meanwhile, the four-bordered neighborhood search is developed based on a new approach. During the assessment, ECOA was challenged to overcome the set of 23 functions and contended with five new metaheuristics: total interaction algorithm (TIA), golden search optimization (GSO), average and subtraction-based optimization (ASBO), COA, and OOA. The result shows that ECOA outperforms TIA, GSO, ASBO, COA, and OOA in 16, 23, 18, 21, and 21 functions. Meanwhile, the individual search test result shows that the directed searches perform better than the neighborhood searches. Moreover, the directed search toward the best member becomes the most dominant search. \u00a9 (2024), (International Association of Engineers).

Some prospective raw materials for hydrogel synthesis are cellulose and its derivatives: sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). This research focuses on hydrogels synthesized from cellulose-NaCMC-citric acid and HEC-NaCMC-citric acid. This study aims to determine the effect of cellulose, NaCMC, and HEC composition on the characterization of hydrogels. Characterization methods used in this research include determination of swelling ratio and gel fraction, FTIR analysis, and morphology analysis using SEM. The first step of making hydrogel involves dissolving each cellulose, HEC, NaCMC, and citric acid in distilled water. Cellulose solution, NaCMC solution, and citric acid (CA) solution were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1:1, 2:1:1, 3:1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:3:1. The resulting mixtures were molded and oven-dried. The same procedures and variations were repeated using HEC as a substitute for cellulose. The swelling ratio was measured at 1 to 7 hours at room temperature. Hydrogel with the highest swelling ratio value of 2012% was obtained with the ratio of cellulose-NaCMC-CA of 1:3:1.

Some prospective raw materials for hydrogel synthesis are cellulose and its derivatives: sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). This research focuses on hydrogels synthesized from cellulose-NaCMC-citric acid and HEC-NaCMC-citric acid. This study aims to determine the effect of cellulose, NaCMC, and HEC composition on the characterization of hydrogels. Characterization methods used in this research include determination of swelling ratio and gel fraction, FTIR analysis, and morphology analysis using SEM. The first step of making hydrogel involves dissolving each cellulose, HEC, NaCMC, and citric acid in distilled water. Cellulose solution, NaCMC solution, and citric acid (CA) solution were mixed with a volume ratio of 1:1:1, 2:1:1, 3:1:1, 1:2:1, and 1:3:1. The resulting mixtures were molded and oven-dried. The same procedures and variations were repeated using HEC as a substitute for cellulose. The swelling ratio was measured at 1 to 7 hours at room temperature. Hydrogel with the highest swelling ratio value of 2012% was obtained with the ratio of cellulose-NaCMC-CA of 1:3:1. The highest gel fraction of 155% was obtained with the ratio of cellulose-NaCMC-CA of 1:1:1. \u00a9 2024 Author(s)."]},{"judul":["Realistic operation and strategic energy, economic and environmental analyses of a hybrid renewable energy based - micro combined heat and power"],"penulis":"Erixno, Oon;Ramadhani, Farah;Rahim, Nasrudin Abd;Rivai, Ahmad","tahun":2024,"sdgs":["Solar EnergyVolume 272April 2024Article number 112467","Document typeArticleSource typeJournalISSN0038092XDOI10.1016\/j.solener.2024.112467View morePublisherElsevier LtdCODENSRENAOriginal languageEnglish","Realistic operation and strategic energy, economic and environmental analyses of a hybrid renewable energy based - micro combined heat and powerErixno, Oona,bSend mail to Erixno O.;Ramadhani, FarahaSend mail to Ramadhani F.;Rahim, Nasrudin Abdb;Rivai, AhmadbSave all to author listaSchool of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Jalan Telekomunikasi No. 1 Bandung 40257, IndonesiabHigher Institution Centre of Excellence (HICoE), UM Power Energy Dedicated Advanced Centre (UMPEDAC), Level 4, Wisma R&D University of Malaya, Jalan Pantai Baharu, Kuala Lumpur, 59990, Malaysia","Realistic operation and strategic energy, economic and environmental analyses of a hybrid renewable energy based - micro combined heat and power","Erixno, Oona,bSend mail to Erixno O.;Ramadhani, FarahaSend mail to Ramadhani F.;Rahim, Nasrudin Abdb;Rivai, AhmadbSave all to author list","aSchool of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Jalan Telekomunikasi No. 1 Bandung 40257, IndonesiabHigher Institution Centre of Excellence (HICoE), UM Power Energy Dedicated Advanced Centre (UMPEDAC), Level 4, Wisma R&D University of Malaya, Jalan Pantai Baharu, Kuala Lumpur, 59990, Malaysia","Full text optionsExport","Full text optionsExport","AbstractAuthor keywordsIndexed keywordsSustainable Development Goals 2023SciVal TopicsMetricsFunding details","AbstractThe expansion of emerging energy sources that are sustainable and cleaner has opened the chance for CHP systems to be integrated for higher efficiency and performance. Prior to the operation in a real system, the integrated micro-CHP system needs a comprehensive performance analysis. Combining with a realistic energy management, the strategic operation must be dealing with the complexity of the system components at the optimal energy serving cost and keep it environmentally friendly. This study develops and analyses the m-CHP system that integrates renewable energy sources coupled with a realistic load-based management. The components control and system management are developed through a validation of the actual data for each component and integrating them in a simulation environment using LABVIEW to ensure the system works as intended. The comprehensive assessments are conducted in terms of energy, economic and environmental aspects to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the system in the long-term practices. In addition, a critical comparison of the proposed method with the existing projects locally in Malaysia and globally is presented to illustrate the potential of the m-CHP for public and private buildings. During 25 years of the operation, the proposed m-CHP system achieved a primary energy savings ratio of 44.7 %, with a net present value of USD 17,790.42.

Data were collected from the financial and annual reports of 165 Islamic rural banks across the nation, with a focused sample of 30 banks in the West Java region, spanning the years 2016 to 2021. The analysis, conducted through EViews version 10, employed multiple linear regression analysis on panel data to ascertain the relationships in question. It was found that non-performing financing (NPF) exerts a significant adverse effect on the sustainability of these banks' operations, whereas a positive influence is observed in the case of the capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Furthermore, digital transformation was identified as a critical moderating factor, enhancing the negative impact of NPF and bolstering the positive impact of CAR on business sustainability. The findings suggest that Islamic rural banks in Indonesia embarking on digital transformation initiatives must prioritize information transparency, financial stability, and the cultivation of innovative capabilities. Additionally, the selection of digital transformation strategies should be tailored to the banks' unique characteristics, including property rights, operational scale, and growth potential.
